      <h2>Artist, Student, Dreamer</h2>
      <p>Ever since I watched the first episode of Sailor Moon and saw the vibrant colors and smooth animation, I realize what my dream career will be: an animator and/or character designer. Animations in movies and series encompassed most of my life, fueling me to become an animator. Animations have something that other forms of media don't, which is the ability to touch other people's hearts. Animations have stuck with me most of my life and I still remember them vividly and fondly as I looked back and watched old series again. I thought that maybe I would do just that someday: to make a creation come to life and touch others' hearts.</p>
